"Responsive" web design is all the rage & is made possible with [CSS Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries)... but [Media Queries are a hack](http://ianstormtaylor.com/media-queries-are-a-hack/).  Media Queries allow layouts to adapt to the size of the viewport, but if you want to adapt to anything else, tough luck.  The CSS standards body has received an [onslaught](http://www.xanthir.com/b4PR0) of requests for "Element Queries" - because web designers are desperate to achieve higher levels of adaptiveness with their layouts.  The idea with Element Queries is simple - individual elements can be responsive to their own size, which would allow for richer designs & more modular Style Sheets.  Instead of addressing the engineering challenges, the [W3C has decided to avoid it all together](http://www.xanthir.com/b4PR0).

Which brings us to `@if` and `@else` directives.  Think of them as a general replacement for Media Queries and the much desired Element Query.  

As an example, if we wanted a set of CSS rules to kick when the screen is less than 960px:

{% highlight css %}

/* GSS: */

@if ::window[width] < 960 {
  /* ... */
}

/* Old-school Media Queries: */

@media screen and (max-width: 960px) {
  /* ... */
}

{% endhighlight %}

But, any property can be used within an `@if`, `@else` conditional.  So, if you want a layout to be responsive to a panel's width:

{% highlight css %}
@if #panel[width] >= 800 {
  /* ... */
}
@else #panel[width] >= 500 {
  /* ... */
}
@else {
  /* ... */
}

/* Not possible with Media Queries */
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight css %}

@if #panel[width] >= 500 {
  @horizontal .item;  
  #button {
    font-size: == 18;
  }
}
@else {
  @vertical .item;
  #button {
    font-size: == 14;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
