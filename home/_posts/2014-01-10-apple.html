Let's say we have a `#panel` and four buttons, `#b1`, `#b2`, `#b3` and `#b4`.  We want the panel to `#panel` be in the middle of the screen and we want `#b3` to strongly prefer to be in middle of the panel unless it gets too close to the other buttons, and we want the other buttons to align horizontally separated by a gap of 8px. 

{% highlight css %}
#panel[center-x] == ::window[center-x];

#b3[center-x] == #panel[center-x] !strong;

@horizontal |-[#b1]-[#b2]~-~[b3]~-~[#b]-| in(#panel) gap(8);
{% endhighlight %}
