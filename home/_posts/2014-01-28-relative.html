  Notice how you naturally would describe the above layout of iOS devices:
</p>

<blockquote>
  "The bottom of the iPhone & iPad should be equal. The middle of the iPhone should prefer to equal the right edge of the iPad, but the right edge of the iPhone cannot get too close to..."
</blockquote>

  With CSS, we have turn these basic intentions into arcane syntax positioned floats of inline-blocks.  With GSS, the syntax is closer to our intentions:
</p>

<p>
  #iphone[bottom] == #ipad[bottom];
</p>
