<p>CSS was designed to decouple presentation &amp; content, but even with Flexbox, a trivial change in layout can require manic HTML reshuffling.  The CSS layout primitives are inadequate; it doesn't really matter that some div is 720px wide - what matters is how it relates to other elements in the layout.  WTF, why can't we position &amp; size elements relative to each other, not just relative to their positioned parents?  Because "cyclic dependencies" would naturally arise... Sounds like a classic constraint satisfaction problem - JavaScript to the rescue!

GSS is a CSS preprocessor &amp; JS runtime that harnesses Cassowary.js, the JS port of the same constraint solving algorithm Apple uses to compute layout in iOS &amp; OS X, to rectify CSS's most vexing problems.  GSS levels up CSS with Relative Positioning &amp; Sizing,
True Source Order Independence, Weighted Inequality Constraints, Apple's Visual Format Language (VFL), and much more...
