# Signup Form

A signup form for web properties.


## TODO

* Documentation
  - JS doc format
  - Usage examples in README
  - Dev commands


## Potential improvements

Not all desired features could be implemented due to some current technical limitations and time constraints.

These are areas where the project can be improved:

* Default (scoped) styling
* Removal of workarounds for GSS and volatile DOM
 - Particularly `useTemplate`
