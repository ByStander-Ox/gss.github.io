The age of "Responsive Web Design" is upon us and it's mandate for designs that elegantly adapt to the user's viewing context has made
web dev "hard, really hard, actually" as Mr Jeff Croft [lamented](http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2012/mar/02/implementing-responsive-design/).
Conceptualizing Responsive layouts is difficult enough, but implementing such layouts with
[CSS Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries) is an awkward affair
because as Ian Taylor [illuminated](http://ianstormtaylor.com/media-queries-are-a-hack/), Media Queries are a hack.

## Element Queries

Media Queries allow layouts to adapt to the size of the viewport, but if you want to adapt to anything else, tough luck.
W3C members have received an [onslaught](http://www.xanthir.com/b4PR0) of requests for "Element Queries" - because web designers
are desperate to achieve higher levels of adaptiveness with their layouts.  The idea with Element Queries is simple - individual elements
can be responsive to their own size, which would allow for richer designs & more modular Style Sheets. W3C have
[start discussion](http://responsiveimagescg.github.io/eq-usecases/) about element queries but as this point they still don't have official
endorsement of element queries.

Yet, even with the hypothetical Element Query, elements could only be adaptive to their size.  Why not allow elements to be adaptive to any property
like `col-count` or even to a custom variable?

## Arbitrary Property Conditionals

Which brings us to `@if` and `@else` directives.  Think of them as a more expressive replacement for Media Queries and the
much desired Element Query, that allow CSS rules to be adaptive to any arbitrary property or custom constraint variable.
<a href="http://codepen.io/thegridgssdocs/pen/emEaQR" target="_blank">Live example.</a>

Instead of continuing the tradition of the Query types; `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height` & `max-height`; for every
available CSS property, `@if` `@else` directives use the conditional operators: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`, `==`, `or`, and `and`.

As an example, if we wanted a set of CSS rules to kick when the screen is less than 960px:

{% highlight css %}

/* GSS: */
@if ::window[width] < 960 {
  /* ... */
}

/* Old-school Media Queries: */
@media screen and (max-width: 960px) {
  /* ... */
}

{% endhighlight %}

But, any property can be used within an `@if`, `@else` conditional.  So, if you want a layout to be responsive to a section's width:

{% highlight css %}

section {
  article {
    @if ^[width] <= 400 {
      width: == ^[width];
      height: == ^[height] / 2;
    }
    @else  {
      width: == ^[width] / 2;
      height: == ^[height];
    }
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

When the width of the section element goes below 400px, the article elements will be
constrained by the @if block, otherwise by the @else block.

### Constraint evaluation within conditionals
In order to determine if a conditional holds, GSS needs to evaluate every constraints outside of the conditional before evaluating if it is met.
This includes constraints appearing after the conditional's declaration.

As explained in the [GSS constraints guide](/guide/constraints), the constraint declaration order can affect the
resulting solution.

In the following example, if the conditional is true, the constraint within it will be added to the solver after the outer constraints.
This causes the constraint within the conditional to overcome the constraints of equal strength when the conditional evaluates as true.

{% highlight css %}

#elm[width] == ::window[width];

@if elm[width] < 400 {
  #elm[height] == 300;
}

#elm[height] == 500;

{% endhighlight %}

In this example, if the `width` of the screen is smaller than 400px, the `height` of the element will be constrained to 300px even
though there's a `height` constraint defined after the condition.

### Condition looping
As described in the [GSS constraints guide](/guide/constraints), constraints are two-way. This should be carefully considered when using
conditionals. Although GSS has been designed to detect and prevent cases when looping could occur, complex nesting of conditionals can
still cause infinite loops.

For example, since the conditional below changes a variable that is being checked, it would appear that it will lead to an infinite loop.
However, the underlying constraint solver in GSS can determine a solution that satisfies constraints without looping.

{% highlight css %}

#elm[width] == 800;
.someElm[width] == #elm[width];

@if #elm[width] <= 400 {
  .someElm[width] == 600;
}

{% endhighlight %}
