## Selectors

In order to apply constraints to elements, you first need to select and observe them from the DOM. GSS supports
the following basic selectors. <a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/Eavbyd" target="_blank">Live example.</a>

#### Elements

{% highlight css %}

  div[width] == 100;

{% endhighlight %}

GSS supports the `*` selector meaning all elements of the page will be selected.

#### Classes

{% highlight css %}

  .className[width] == 100;

{% endhighlight %}

Using the element's class attribute `<div class='className'></div>` this selector will select
all elements that have the class `className`.

#### ID

{% highlight css %}

  #elementId[width] == 100;

{% endhighlight %}

<a name="combinators"></a>
## Combinators
Combinators are used to combine basic selectors to allow more fine grained selection of elements.
 <a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/WbEXKd" target="_blank">Live example.</a>

The following combinators can be use in GSS:

#### Union

{% highlight css %}

div, .className {
  width: == 100;
}

/* inline syntax */
(div, .className)[width] == 100;

{% endhighlight %}

For all `div` elements and elements having the `.className` class, a `width` of 100 will be constrained. `div` elements
having the `.className` class will be selected only once.

<a name="descendant"></a>
#### All descendant elements

{% highlight css %}
div .className {
  width: == 100;
}

/* inline syntax */
(div .className)[width] == 100;
{% endhighlight %}

Select all elements having the `className` class define that are descendants of a `div` element.

#### Attribute selector

{% highlight css %}
div.className {
  width: == 100;
}

/* inline syntax */
(div.className)[width] == 100;
{% endhighlight %}

Select all `div` elements that have the `className` class.

#### All child elements

{% highlight css %}
div > .className {
  width: == 100;
}

/* inline syntax */
(div > .className)[width] == 100;
{% endhighlight %}

For each `div` element, select its direct child' element if the child element has the `className` class.

#### Next sibling element

{% highlight css %}

div + .className {
  width: == 100;
}

/* inline syntax */
(div + .className)[width] == 100;

{% endhighlight %}

Select the direct succeeding sibling elements of all `div` if those siblings have the `className` class.

#### All direct sibling elements

{% highlight css %}

div ++ .className {
  width: == 100;
}

/* inline syntax */
(div ++ .className)[width] == 100;

{% endhighlight %}

Select the previous and next direct sibling elements of all `div` if those siblings have the `className` class.

#### All succeeding sibling elements
{% highlight css %}
div ~ .className {
  width: == 100;
}

/* inline syntax */
(div ~ .className)[width] == 100;
{% endhighlight %}

Select all succeeding sibling elements of `div` that have the `className` class.

#### All sibling elements

{% highlight css %}

div ~~ .className {
  width: == 100;
}

/* inline syntax */
(div ~~ .className)[width] == 100;

{% endhighlight %}

Select all preceeding and succeeding sibling elements of `div` that have the `className` class.

### Performance consideration
For GSS selectors that are supported by CSS, GSS will use the CSS native selectors. For non CSS native selectors, GSS will
filter the collection of elements selected by native CSS selectors. Performance wise, it is therefore preferable to
use native selector as much as possible.

## Combinators limitation
Combinators requires a selector on both side of the combination. For example the following is not currently supported:

{% highlight css %}

div ~ {
  top: == 100;
}

{% endhighlight %}

You can use the `*` to get the same results

{% highlight css %}

div ~ * {
  top: == 100;
}

{% endhighlight %}


<a name="reversecombinators"></a>
## Reverse Combinators

For parent-child selector, the reverse combinator `!` allows you to reverse the selector relationship
to child-parent. For sibling selectors, the reverse combinator `!` allows you to go up in the DOM for
the selection. <a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/jELaRK" target="_blank">Live example.</a>

#### All parent elements

{% highlight css %}

  div ! .className {
  	width: == 100;
  }

  /* inline syntax */
  (div ! .className)

{% endhighlight %}

Select elements with the `.className` class that are parents of a `div` element.

#### Direct parent elements

{% highlight css %}

  div !> .className {
  	width: == 100;
  }

{% endhighlight %}

Select elements with the `.className` class that are direct parents of a `div` element.

#### Previous sibling element

{% highlight css %}

  div !+ .className {
  	width: == 100;
  }

{% endhighlight %}

Select the direct previous sibling elements of `div` elements having the `className` class.

#### All preceeding sibling elements

{% highlight css %}

  div !~ .className {
  	width: == 100;
  }

{% endhighlight %}


<a name="pseudoclasses"></a>
## Pseudo-classes

When using selectors, GSS creates a collection of matching elements and then iterates over those elements
to apply the constraints you've defined. Pseudo-classes allows you to further select an element within that collection.

The following pseudo-classes are supported in GSS.

#### :next element in the collection

{% highlight css %}

  div {
  	top: == &:next;
  }

{% endhighlight %}

The `div` selector will create a collection of matching `div` elements. The pseudo-classes `:next` in this example will select
the next `div` in the collection relative to the current div which is represented by `&`.

#### :previous element in the collection

{% highlight css %}

div {
  top: == &:previous;
}

{% endhighlight %}

Selects the previous element in the collection.

#### First element in the collection

{% highlight css %}

div:first[size] == 100;

{% endhighlight %}

Selects the first `div` found and add a constraint of 100px on the `size`.

#### Last element in the collection

{% highlight css %}

div:last[size] == 100;

{% endhighlight %}

Selects the last div found and add a constraint of 100px on the `size`.


<a name="pseudoselectors"></a>
## Special pseudo selectors

GSS provides the following special pseudo selectors:

### Parent selector ^

{% highlight css %}

section {
  .className {
    width: == ^[width];
  }
}

/* Alternative syntax */
.className {
  width: == ::parent[width];
}

{% endhighlight %}

As we've seen previously, GSS will iterate over all selected elements to apply contraints.
When using the `^` pseudo selector, you are asking GSS to refer to the parent ruleset element.
<a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/JoyMpR" target="_blank">Live example.</a>

You can chain pseudo parent selector. In the following, GSS will access the current `className` parent's parent which in
this case would be a `section` element.

{% highlight css %}

section {
  article {
    .className {
      width: == ^^[width];
    }
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

As previously mentionned it is important to understand that the parent pseudo selector will select
an element according to the ruleset scope and not the DOM. As you can see in the next example, the `div` are
constraints against their ruleset parent element and not their DOM parent. <a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/JoyMpR" target="_blank">Live example.</a>

### this selector &

{% highlight css %}

.className {
  line-height: == &[font-size] + 10;
}

/* Alternatives syntaxes */

.className {
  line-height: == ::this[font-size] + 10;
}

.otherClass {
  line-height: == ::[font-size] + 10;
}

{% endhighlight %}

In this example, the line-height of the selected element will by 10px more than its own font-size.

### ::window selector

{% highlight css %}

.className {
  width: == ::window[width] / 2;
}

{% endhighlight %}

The `::window` selector gives you access to the visible part of the page in the browser. The `::window` width and height don't take
into consideration scroll bars.

Scrolling the page will not re-calculate constraints using the `::window` so you need to keep this in mind when constraining elements
in relation to the `::window` pseudo selector.

In the next example, the gray `div` will be centered with `::window` but as you can see scrolling don't have any
effect on its position. <a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/jELKpr" target="_blank">Live example</a>


### Global scope selector $

The global scope allows you to select elements from the root of the DOM three when selecting elements within rulesets. The root
element is the element in which you instantiate the GSS engine.

{% highlight css %}

.className {
  line-height: == ($ #elm)[line-height];
}

{% endhighlight %}

## Selector within rulesets
Using selectors within rulesets is the equivalent of using the [descendant](#descendant) combinator. In the following example,
a constraint on the `.className` element will only be define if that element has a descendant element with an id equal to `#elm`.

{% highlight css %}

.className {
  line-height: == #elm[line-height];
}

/* is the equivalent of */

.className[line-height] == (.className #elm)[line-height];

{% endhighlight %}


<a name="selectorsplats"></a>
## Selector splat
Selector splat enables you to select elements having a sequence number in their ID or class name.
<a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/yyoWeN" target="_blank">Live example</a>

{% highlight css %}

.parent.btn0...2.featured[x] <= 0

/* is the equivalent of doing : * /
.parent.btn0.featured[x] <= 0
.parent.btn1.featured[x] <= 0
.parent.btn2.featured[x] <= 0

{% endhighlight %}

The splat sequence can start at the number you want:

{% highlight css %}

.btn2...4.featured[x] <= 0

/* which is the equivalent of: * /
.btn2.featured[x] <= 0
.btn3.featured[x] <= 0
.btn4.featured[x] <= 0

{% endhighlight %}

You can chain splat selectors like this for ID or class names having multiple number sequences in them:

{% highlight css %}

#cell-x1...2-y1...2-z1...2[width] == 10;

/* which is the equivalent of: * /
#cell-x1-y1-z1[width] == 10;
#cell-x2-y2-z2[width] == 10;
#cell-x3-y3-z3[width] == 10;
#cell-x1-y1-z1[width] == 10;
#cell-x2-y2-z2[width] == 10;
#cell-x3-y3-z3[width] == 10;
#cell-x1-y1-z1[width] == 10;
#cell-x2-y2-z2[width] == 10;
#cell-x3-y3-z3[width] == 10;

{% endhighlight %}

## Selectors and the DOM

The collection of elements built from selectors is built according to the DOM elements order and not in the order in which
you positionned them with GSS.

For example, if you have GSS constraints that positions all `section` elements to appear before `div` elements, the following example
will not take that positionning into account when using the `:next` pseudo-class.

{% highlight css %}

section[bottom] <= div[top];

section, div {
	top: == &:next[top];
}

{% endhighlight %}

In this case, if some `div` comes first in the DOM, they will be added to the collection of selected elements before `section` elements. So
`&:next` can return either a `section` element or a `div` element depending on the DOM order.

Depending on your intention, this can make total sense but keep in mind that these constraints will be applied base on the DOM order.

### Selector specificity
Selector specificity is not supported in GSS.

> "...constraints can be used to specify declaratively the desired layout of a web document. They allow partial specification of the layout, which can be combined with other partial specifications in a predictable way. They also provide a uniform mechanism for understanding layout and cascading." [Greg J. Badros](http://www.badros.com/greg/papers/css-uist99.pdf)

Let's take the following example,

{% highlight css %}

div[width] == #someElm[width];
div[width] == .className[width];
div[width] == section[width];

{% endhighlight %}

With CSS, the selector specificity would set the `div` width to equal the `#someElm` `width` since the ID selector has a higher score than class and tag selectors.

With GSS, these three constraints will be evaluated and since later constraints overcomes previous ones, the width of the
`div` in this example would be equal to the `section` width. So if you want to give higher priority to `#someElm` you can set a
higher strength on it:

{% highlight css %}

div[width] == #someElm[width] !strong;
div[width] == .className[width];
div[width] == section[width];

{% endhighlight %}

<a name="pluralbinding"></a>
## Plural binding
Let's say you have the following DOM elements:

{% highlight html %}

<section id="s1"></section>
<section id="s1"></section>
<section id="s1"></section>

<article id="a1"></article>
<article id="a1"></article>

{% endhighlight %}

What happens if you do declare the following constraint on these elements:

{% highlight css %}

section[width] == article[width];

{% endhighlight %}

GSS will do plural binding between these elements, which means it will pair elements together in order to apply constraint.
Plural binding will give the equivalent of the following constraints:

{% highlight html %}

#s1[width] == #a1[width];
#s2[width] == #a2[width];
#s3[width] == ?

{% endhighlight %}

As you can see here, no constraint will be declare on `#s3` since there wasn't any element to pair with.

### Two selectors per expression
GSS limits to two the number of distinct selectors in a GSS expression. As for now the following is not supported:

{% highlight css %}
    #div4[width] == #div1[width] + #div2[width] + #div3[width];
{% endhighlight %}

This limitation only applies for distinct selectors. For example the following is ok since we're using `div1` twice:

{% highlight css %}
    #div4[width] == #div1[width] + #div1[height] + #div3[width];
{% endhighlight %}

The support for more than three selectors in GSS expression will probably be added in a near future but in meantime you can
do something like:

{% highlight css %}
[tempSum] = #div1[width] + #div2[width];
#div4[width] == [tempSum] + #div3[width];
{% endhighlight %}
