Constraints allows you to design great layout.

## Constraints

Constraints express relationships between variables that [may or may not hold](#mayofmaynothold). You can constrain any numerical style property of an element, not just its position & size.

For example, if I want all paragraph tags to have line-height greater than 16px and less than 1/12th the size of the window:

{% highlight css %}

p[line-height] >= 16;
p[line-height] <= ::window[height] / 12;

{% endhighlight %}

### May or may not hold? 
GSS will try to find the best solution that satisfies the constraints you've defined. By default, GSS use what we call soft constraints which means that it is preferred but not required that certain constraints be satisfied. 

For example:

{% highlight css %}

div[size] == 10;

{% endhighlight %}

Once solved, the div might have a size other than 10 if that's the best size for div that GSS found in order to satisfy the most constraints you've define. You can guide GSS in your constraint intention using [Strenghts](http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/NPdgwm).

### Equality and Inequality

What's the impact of doing a ==, >= or <= on the layout?


## Selectors

GSS supports the following list of selectors: 

+ Selector One
+ Selector Two
+ Selector Three

{% highlight css %}

  .Selector[width]: == 100;

{% endhighlight %}

### Specificity

Here's how GSS deals with specificity. 


## Rules

To define a rule: 

{% highlight css %}

  .Selector {
    width: == 100;
  }

{% endhighlight %}

## Variables and scope

Variable and scope documentation here.

{% highlight css %}

  .Selector {
    width: == 100;
  }

{% endhighlight %}



## Dimensions and positions

Dimensions and positions documentation here.

{% highlight css %}

.Selector {
  width: == 100;
}

{% endhighlight %}



## Intrinsic values

Intrinsic values documentation here.

{% highlight css %}

  .Selector {
    width: == 100;
  }

{% endhighlight %}

## Virtuals

Virtual documentation here.

{% highlight css %}

  .Selector {
    width: == 100;
  }

{% endhighlight %}
