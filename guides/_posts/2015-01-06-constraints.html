Constraints allows you to design great layout.

## Constraints

Constraints express [relationships between variables](#constraintsaretwoways) that [may or may not hold](#mayofmaynothold). You can constrain any numerical style property of an element, not just its position & size.

For example, if I want all paragraph tags to have line-height greater than 16px and less than 1/12th the size of the window:

  {% highlight css %}

p[line-height] >= 16;
p[line-height] <= ::window[height] / 12;

{% endhighlight %}

### Constraints declaration

Let's go through the syntax for declaring a constraint:

`p[line-height] >= 16;`

+ `p` is the selector. This constraint will apply to every `p` tag in the page.
+ `[]` is the style property selector.
+ `line-height` is the style property for which a value will be calculated by GSS.
+ `>=` defines an inequality constraint. You can declare inequality and equality constraint.
+ `16` is the numerical value for the constraint in pixel unit. The default unit in GSS are pixels.

### Constraints are 2-ways
Do not confuse an equality constraint with your everyday variable assignment. For example, in a vanilla programming paradigm:

{% highlight javascript %}

// vanilla programming

x = y;
y = 10
x = 100;

// x => 100, y => 10

{% endhighlight %}

x will be 100, and y will be 10.  With constraint programming, equality constraints are two-way, so:

{% highlight javascript %}

// constraint programming

x == y;
x == 100;
y >= 10;

// x => 100, y => 100

{% endhighlight %}

x and y have a constraint to be equal, so x and y will be 100.

Constraints are incrementally added to a `solver`, then the solver computes a feasible & optimal solution to all the constraints.  With constraint programming you input the *what* you want to happen, not *how* it will happen. With procedural programming, you focus on the *how*.  This makes constraints a perfect fit for empowering declarative languages like CSS.


<a name="mayofmaynothold"></a>
### Constraints May or may not hold
GSS will find the best solution that satisfies the constraints you've defined. By default, GSS use what we call soft constraints which means that it is preferred but not required that certain constraints be satisfied.

For example:

{% highlight css %}

  #gss {
    width: == 200;
  }

  #cassowary {
    width: == 200;
  }

  #gss[width] + #cassowary[width] == 350;

{% endhighlight %}

In the previous example, we're asking GSS to give the `#GSS` and `#cassowary` elements a width of 200px and we
later ask cassowary to constraint the sum of these two element to be equal to 350px. In this case, one the the
two constraints will not hold. As we'll see later in the documentation you can influence the constraints solving
by given more intent to GSS about what you want. <a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/XJROdV" target="_blank">Live example.</a>

### Strenghts
Strenghts allows you to guide GSS in your layout intention by giving the GSS constraints solver more details about which constraints you prioritize.

Stronger constraints completely overcome weaker ones - this is the phenomena of the [Constraint Hierarchy](http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/constraints/theory/hierarchies-92.html).  Strengths are declared in the same fashion of CSS's `!important`:

{% highlight css %}

/* Stronger constraints completely overcome weaker ones */

#light[years] == 100 !weak;
#light[years] == 200 !medium;
#light[years] == 300 !strong;

/* #light[years] will be 300 */

{% endhighlight %}

There are 4 levels of built-in strength:

- `!weak`
- `!medium`
- `!strong`
- `!require`

`!medium` is the default for all constraints when no strenght is explicitly

#### Strenghts example
Using the [May or may not hold example](#mayofmaynothold) we saw previously, in this example will give
more strenght to the  `#GSS` and `#cassowary` elements to make sure they overcome the sum
constraints. <a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/bNRbQg" target="_blank">Live example.</a>


#### !require strenght
`!require` is a special strength that guarantees the constraint will hold, otherwise everything breaks.

**Pro Tip** Use `!require` carefully & sparingly.  `!require`'s quickly lead to systems where
all required constraints cannot be satisfied.

For example, the following GSS expressions will be unsolvable:

{% highlight css %}

  #gss {
    width: == 200 !require;
  }

  #cassowary {
    width: == 200 !require;
  }

  #gss[width] + #cassowary[width] == 350 !require;

{% endhighlight %}

We're asking GSS to find a solution where the width of the #gss and #cassowary element must absolutely be 200px
and their sum must absolutly be 350px which is impossible.

### Constraints order
Generally speaking, later constraint statements are more powerful than earlier ones. There could be exception
to this behavior as well see in the following sections when using conditions.

Taking the [May or may not hold example](#mayofmaynothold) we saw previously, by changing the order you'll get a
different result. <a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/rawBRr" target="_blank">Live example.</a>


## Units of measurement
Default unit in GSS are pixels. When omiting the unit, pixels will be use. GSS supports the following units:

+ px
+ em
+ %

## Selectors

GSS Selectors guide: [view all selectors](/guides/selectors)

## Rulesets
GSS allows you to declare constraint using ruleset as with CSS:

{% highlight css %}
  .Selector {
    width: == 100;
  }
{% endhighlight %}

Within a ruleset, constraints are defined on properties using the same syntax as CSS using the colon `:`.

Rulesets can be nested:

{% highlight css %}
Section > article {
   .someclass {
       width: == 100;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

You can defined CSS alongside GSS in rules:

{% highlight css %}
div {
   background-color: green;
   width: <= 200;
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Pro Tip** We recommand keeping your styling with CSS and layout with GSS in seperates style elements or files.

### Rulesets and selectors
Rulesets will scope the nested selectors to all descendant of the ruleset elements. For example:

{% highlight css %}
div {
  width: <= #elm[width];
}
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, GSS will search for a descendant element of a div having an element with `id='elm'`.
Its important to understand that the constraints will be define independantly for each instance of
`div` found. For example, if there're two `div` on the page, the first one having a inner `#elm`
element but not the other, the first `div` will have a constraint declare but not the second one since
it doesn't contain a `#elm` element. <a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/yyXPyK" target="_blank">Live example.</a>


If you want to select and element from the entire DOM you need to do the following:

{% highlight css %}
div {
  width: <= ($ #elm)[width];
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to select an element from the element's parent you can use the `^` pseudo selector:

{% highlight css %}

.container {
  div {
    width: <= (^ #elm)[width];
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

In this example `(^ #elm)` will search for a `#elm` element contained in the current element having
the `.container` class. <a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/yyXPej" target="_blank">Live example.</a>


## Variables and scope
Declaring a variable in GSS is as simple as using it:

{% highlight css %}
[var1] == 100;
{% endhighlight %}


Square brackets are optional. The following GSS is equivalent to the previous one:
{% highlight css %}
var1 == 100;
{% endhighlight %}

### Global variable
Global variables can be define using the `$` symbol.

{% highlight css %}
$var1 == 100;
{% endhighlight %}

### Scope
GSS will scope variables base on the location they are first declared. A variable can be scoped
within a style element, within a ruleset or globally for the entire document.

{% highlight css %}
  .Selector {
    width: == 100;
  }
{% endhighlight %}

#### Style sheet
When declaring a variable, by default the variable will be scoped within the style element.
In other words, if you have more than one stylesheet and both have a variable with the same
name, these two variables will be in two different scope and therefore are independant of each other.

{% highlight css %}
<style type="text/gss">
  varX == 100;
  #elm1[width] == varX;
</style>

<style type="text/gss">
  varX == 200;
  #elm2[width] == varX;
</style>
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, `#elm1` will have a width of 100px and `#elm2` will have a width of 200px.
The two `varX` are in distinct scope and are therefore indenpendant from each other.
<a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/EaXmRp" target="_blank">Live example.</a>

#### Ruleset
Variable define inside ruleset are scoped to the ruleset.

{% highlight css %}
.someClass {
  varX == 100;
  width: == varX;
}

.someOtherClass {
  varX == 200;
  width: == varX;
}
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, each `varX` is in a different scope and are therefore independant from
each other. <a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/XJgRPq" target="_blank">Live example.</a>

### Hoisting
When using a variable in GSS, before creating the variable GSS will look on parent'
scopes to see if there's an existing variable with the same name.

For example:

{% highlight css %}
div {
  varX == 40;

  .someClass {
    width: == varX;

    .someNestedClass {
        varY == 45;
        width: == varY;
        top: == varX;
    }

    .someOtherNestedClass {
        varY == 60;
        height: == varY;
        width: == varX;
      }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, `varX` used in the nested selectors is hoisted from the `div` scope. Internally, GSS will go up the
scope tree using the parent pseudo selector `^varX`, if no variable are found at that level GSS will do `^^varX`
and so on until it finds a variable or until it reach the root scope in which case no variable exist so GSS will
create a new on on the scope where it was declared.

`varY` is been declare in sibling rules therefore it will be define in those two scope and these are two distinct
and independent variables. <a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/zxzwXJ" target="_blank">Live example.</a>

#### Prevent a variable from being hoisted
If you don't want your variable to be hoisted to nested scopes you can declare you variable
with a `:` after the variable name:

{% highlight css %}
div {
  varX: == 40;

  .someClass {
    width: == varX; // ^varX will be unreachable.

    .someNestedClass {
      varY == 45;
      width: == varY;
      top: == varX;
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}


#### Override hoisted variables locally
You can override a variable locally within the scope of a ruleset using the `&` pseudo selector:

{% highlight css %}
div {
  varX == 50;

  .className {
    &varX == 60;
    width: == &varX;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, `&[varX]` will be scoped locally to the `.className` ruleset. The `varX` defined
under the `div` selector.

Note the use of the `&` in `width: == &varX;`, without it hoisting would still occur and reference the
equivalent of `^varX` which is constraint to be equal to 50.


## Positions constraints
GSS provide properties to quickly constraint the dimensions and positions of elements. The top-left corner
of the page as the coordinate `x = left = 0, y = top = 0`. When constraining positions in GSS you will
always constraints them base on the `0px, 0px` coordinate of the page.

### Top

{% highlight css %}

  #someElm[top] == 20;

{% endhighlight %}

Place the top of the element 20px from the top of the page. Top is the equivalent of the following:

{% highlight css %}

#someElm[y] == 20;

{% endhighlight %}


### Bottom

{% highlight css %}

#someElm[bottom] == 100;

{% endhighlight %}

Place the bottom of the element 100px from the top of the page. `bottom` is the equivalent of:

{% highlight css %}

#someElm[bottom] == #someElm[top] + #someElm[height];

{% endhighlight %}


### Left

{% highlight css %}

#someElm[left] == 20;

{% endhighlight %}

Place the left of the element 20px from the left of the page. Left is the equivalent of:

{% highlight css %}

#someElm[x] == 20;

{% endhighlight %}


### Right

{% highlight css %}

#someElm[right] == 100;

{% endhighlight %}

Place the right of the element 100px from the left of the page. `right` is the equivalent of:

{% highlight css %}

#someElm[rigth] == #someElm[left] + #someElm[width];

{% endhighlight %}

### position

{% highlight css %}
#someElm[position] == 100;
{% endhighlight %}

Constraining the `position` is the equivalent of constraining:

{% highlight css %}
#someElm[top] == 100;
#somElm[left] == 100;
{% endhighlight %}

### top-left, top-right

{% highlight css %}
#someElm[top-left] == 100;
#otherElm[top-right] == 200;
{% endhighlight %}

Position the `#someElm` top-left corner to be at 100px from the top-left of the page.
Same thing for `#otherElm` excepts its the top-right corner that's been position 200px
from the top-left of the page.


### bottom-left, bottom-right

{% highlight css %}
#someElm[bottom-left] == 100;
#otherElm[bottom-right] == 200;
{% endhighlight %}

Position the `#someElm` bottom-left corner to be at 100px from the top-left of the page.
Same thing for `#otherElm` excepts its the bottom-right corner that's been position 200px
from the top-left of the page.

### center-x, cx

{% highlight css %}
#someElm[center-x] == 100;

// you can also use the condense syntax:
#someElm[cx] == 100;

{% endhighlight %}

Place the horizontal center of the element 100px from the left of the page.

### center-y, cy

{% highlight css %}

#someElm[center-y] == 100;

// you can also use the condense syntax:
#someElm[cy] == 100;

{% endhighlight %}

Place the vertical center of the element 100px from the top of the page.

### Center

{% highlight css %}
#someElm[center] == 100;
{% endhighlight %}

`center` is a 2d property shortcut for doing that will constraint both
`center-x` and `center-y` to be 100px from the top-left corner of the page.

### Relatively positionned parents.

GSS deals with relative parents in two distinct way. One being when the parent `position: relative` property
is declared in a CSS ruleset, the other is when the `position: relative` is declare in the `style` attribute of
the element.

#### position: relative in ruleset
Even if the elements your constraining are placed within an element having the CSS property `position: relative`,
the constraints will calculate absolute position agains the top-left corner of the page.

If you look at the calculated values, you'll see that they account for their relative parent position but are
positionned according to the top-left of the page.


#### position: relative in style attribute

**Pro Tip** If you have within your site some pages with multiple sections, GSS will need calculate the constraints for
all the section at once in order to find the best possible solution. In some case, that can lead to
performance issue. If that's the case, you can position each section using regular CSS by declaring then as
follow:

{% highlight css %}

<section class="relative-container" style="position: relative">
  <div class="container"></div>
</section>

<section class="relative-container" id="section-two" style="position: relative">
  <div class="container"></div>
</section>

<style type="text/gss">

.relative-container {
  x: == 0;
  y: == 0;

  .container {
    @v |-(&)-| in(^) gap(10);
    height: == 100;
    width: == 100;
  }
}

</style>

{% endhighlight %}

In this example, we are constraining `x` and `y` to be zero wich is the top-left corner of the section
element. By doing so, all position constraints will be calculated relative to the section element.

With the `position: relative` declare in the `style` attribute, GSS will solve independently each sections which
will results in better performance. <a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/pvwaNN" target="_blank">Live example.</a>

## Intrinsic values
Intrinsic values documentation here.

{% highlight css %}

  .Selector {
    width: == 100;
  }

{% endhighlight %}

Once an intrinsic value is constrained on a property, GSS will not evaluate other constraints you define on the same property.

## Virtuals
Virtual documentation here.

{% highlight css %}

  .Selector {
    width: == 100;
  }

{% endhighlight %}
