Constraints allows you to design great layout.

## Constraints

Constraints express [relationships between variables](#constraintsaretwoways) that [may or may not hold](#mayofmaynothold). You can constrain any numerical style property of an element, not just its position & size.

For example, if I want all paragraph tags to have line-height greater than 16px and less than 1/12th the size of the window:

  {% highlight css %}

p[line-height] >= 16;
p[line-height] <= ::window[height] / 12;

{% endhighlight %}

### Constraints declaration

Let's go through the syntax for declaring a constraint:

`p[line-height] >= 16;`

+ `p` is the selector. This constraint will apply to every `p` tag in the page.
+ `[]` is the style property selector.
+ `line-height` is the style property for which a value will be calculated by GSS.
+ `>=` defines an inequality constraint. You can declare inequality and equality constraint.
+ `16` is the numerical value for the constraint in pixel unit. The default unit in GSS are pixels.

#### Constraints declaration example

### Constraints are 2-ways
Do not confuse an equality constraint with your everyday variable assignment. For example, in a vanilla programming paradigm:

{% highlight javascript %}

// vanilla programming

x = y;
y = 10
x = 100;

// x => 100, y => 10

{% endhighlight %}

x will be 100, and y will be 10.  With constraint programming, equality constraints are two-way, so:

{% highlight javascript %}

// constraint programming

x == y;
x == 100;
y >= 10;

// x => 100, y => 100

{% endhighlight %}

x and y have a constraint to be equal, so x and y will be 100.

Constraints are incrementally added to a `solver`, then the solver computes a feasible & optimal solution to all the constraints.  With constraint programming you input the *what* you want to happen, not *how* it will happen. With procedural programming, you focus on the *how*.  This makes constraints a perfect fit for empowering declarative languages like CSS.

### Constraints May or may not hold
GSS will find the best solution that satisfies the constraints you've defined. By default, GSS use what we call soft constraints which means that it is preferred but not required that certain constraints be satisfied.

For example:

{% highlight css %}

  #gss {
    width: == 200;
  }

  #cassowary {
    width: == 200;
  }

  #gss[width] + #cassowary[width] == 350;

{% endhighlight %}

In the previous example, we're asking GSS to give the `#GSS` and `#cassowary` elements a width of 200px and we later ask cassowary to constraint the sum of these two element to be equal to 350px. In this case, one the the two constraints will not hold. As we'll see later in the documentation you can influence the constraints solving by given more intent to GSS about what you want.

#### May or may not hold example
In this example, GSS will give a width of 150px to the #gss element in order to satisfy the greatest number of constraints.

### Strenghts
Strenghts allows you to guide GSS in your layout intention by giving the GSS constraints solver more details about which constraints you prioritize.

Stronger constraints completely overcome weaker ones - this is the phenomena of the [Constraint Hierarchy](http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/constraints/theory/hierarchies-92.html).  Strengths are declared in the same fashion of CSS's `!important`:

{% highlight css %}

/* Stronger constraints completely overcome weaker ones */

#light[years] == 100 !weak;
#light[years] == 200 !medium;
#light[years] == 300 !strong;

/* #light[years] will be 300 */

{% endhighlight %}

There are 4 levels of built-in strength:

- `!weak`
- `!medium`
- `!strong`
- `!require`

`!medium` is the default for all constraints when no strenght is explicitly

#### Strenghts example
Using the [May or may not hold example](#mayofmaynothold) we saw previously, in this example will give more strenght to the  `#GSS` and `#cassowary` elements to make sure they overcome the sum constraints.

<a href="http://codepen.io/cbchouinard/pen/bNRbQg" target="_blank">Changing strenght example</a>


#### !require strenght
`!require` is a special strength that guarantees the constraint will hold, otherwise everything breaks.

**Pro Tip** Use `!require` carefully & sparingly.  `!require`'s quickly lead to systems where all required constraints cannot be satisfied.

For example, the following GSS expressions will be unsolvable:

{% highlight css %}

  #gss {
    width: == 200 !require;
  }

  #cassowary {
    width: == 200 !require;
  }

  #gss[width] + #cassowary[width] == 350 !require;

{% endhighlight %}

We're asking GSS to find a solution where the width of the #gss and #cassowary element must absolutely be 200px and their sum must absolutly be 350px which is impossible.

### Constraints order
Generally speaking, later constraint statements are more powerful than earlier ones. There could be exception to this behavior as well see in the following sections when using conditions.

Taking the [May or may not hold example](#mayofmaynothold) we saw previously, by changing the order you'll get a different result.

## Selectors

GSS Selectors guide: [view all selectors](/guides/selectors)

## Rules
GSS allows you to declare constraint using ruleset as with CSS:

{% highlight css %}
  .Selector {
    width: == 100;
  }
{% endhighlight %}

Within a ruleset, constraints are defined on properties using the same syntax as CSS using the colon `:`.  

Rulesets can be nested:

{% highlight css %}
Section > article {
   .someclass {
       width: == 100;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

You can defined CSS alongside GSS in rules:

{% highlight css %}
div {
   background-color: red;
   width: <= 200;
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Pro Tip** We recommand keeping your styling with CSS and layout with GSS in seperates style elements or files.

### Rulesets and selectors
Rulesets define scope for variable but also for selectors. For example:

{% highlight css %}
div {
  width: <= #elm[width];
}
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, GSS will search for a descendant element of a div having an element with `id='elm'`. If you want to select from the entire DOM you need to do the following:

{% highlight css %}
div {
  width: <= ($ #elm)[width];
}
{% endhighlight %}


## Variables and scope
Declaring a variable in GSS is as simple as using it:

{% highlight css %}
[var1] == 100;
{% endhighlight %}


Square brackets are optional. The following GSS is equivalent to the previous one:
{% highlight css %}
var1 == 100;
{% endhighlight %}

This just define a variable name var1 and assign the value 100 pixels to it.


### Global variable
$[var1] == 100; will be gobally define.



### Scope
GSS will scope variables base on the location they are first declared. A variable can be scoped within a style element, within a ruleset or even globally for the entire document.

{% highlight css %}
  .Selector {
    width: == 100;
  }
{% endhighlight %}

#### Style sheet
When declaring a variable, by default the variable will be scoped within the style element. In other words, if you have more than
one stylesheet and both have a variable with the same name, these two variables will be in two different scope and therefore are independant of each other.

#### Ruleset
Variable define within rules and accessible to declaration within the rule set and not outside.

#### Hoisting
When using a variable GSS, before creating the variable GSS will look on parent scope to see if there's an existing variable with the same name.

For example:

{% highlight css %}
div {
  [var3] == 40;
    .someClass {
      width: == [var3];

      .someNestedClass {
        [varX] == 45;
        width: == [var3];
        top: == [varX];
      }

      .someOtherNestedClass {
        [varX] == 60;
        height: == [varX];
        width: == [var3];
      }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, var3 used in the nested classes is hoisted from the div scope. Internally GSS will go up the scope three using the parent selector `^[var3]`, `^^[var3]` and so on until it finds a variable or until it reach the root scope in which case no variable exist so GSS will create a new on on the scope where it was declared.

`[varX]` is been declare in sibling rules therefore it will be define in those two scope and these are two distinct and independent variables.

#### Override variable locally
You can override a variable locally within the scope of a ruleset using the `&` operator.

{% highlight css %}
div {
  [var1] == 50;

  .className {
    &[var1] == 60;
  }  
}
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, `&[var1]` will be scoped locally to the .className ruleset. The `[var1]` defined under the div selector.
